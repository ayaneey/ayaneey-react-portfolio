				Hi! My name is Ayan, I am 26 years old. Prior to this course, I was a
				qualified Secondary English teacher. I qualified about 2 years ago. I
				chose to embark on this Bootcamp course not only for an opportunity of a
				career change but to seek more challenges, enhance my knowledge of
				technology and learning in general! Being in this Bootcamp has taught me
				invaluable skills such as strengthening my technical and problem-solving
				skills but most importantly, but has given me a glimpse into the
				working-life of a developer.
